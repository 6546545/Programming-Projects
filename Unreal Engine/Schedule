**Month 7-8: Gameplay Mechanics and Systems**
- Finalize gameplay mechanics, including combat, movement, and interaction.
- Develop core systems such as inventory, upgrades, and character progression.
- Create a prototype for gameplay mechanics to test their feasibility.

**Year 2: Production, Testing, and Polishing**

**Month 9-10: Environment Art and Level Design**
- Begin creating environmental assets and terrain for different regions.
- Design individual areas, landmarks, and points of interest within the world.

- Develop a playable vertical slice of the game for internal testing.

**Month 17-18: Testing and Iteration**
- Conduct playtesting sessions to gather feedback on gameplay, pacing, and bugs.
- Iterate on mechanics, level design, and user interface based on playtest results.
- Optimize performance and fix bugs identified during testing.

**Month 19-20: Polishing and Finalization**
- Focus on refining visuals, audio, and user experience.
- Implement sound effects, music, and voice acting.
- Polish quests, dialogues, and character interactions for a seamless experience.

**Month 21-22: Quality Assurance and Launch Preparation**
